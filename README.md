# Project title

Bank tech test: this is a common tech test, which I will complete to test my ability as a developer. It will test my OO
and TDD skills, it will be completed solo.

### Motivation / Approach

This project was made to develop my software development skills, in this case, in Ruby and Rspec. I will attempt to TDD
the project, providing good code coverage and following SOLID principles.

I firstly created the repo on Github, and this readme, to contemplate the approach I will take with the project, and to
consider user stories, and therefore the classes and objects that are going to be required. I then installed the
required software (Rspec for testing).

### Build status

The project is currently under construction, it may not be completed as this is a practice exercise. I will update this
readme once I am happy with the final code quality / programme. 

### Screenshots / UML / Notes / Diagrams

Should there be any images, please find them in the images folder of the repo.

### User Stories

As a bank customer,
So that i can keep my money safe,
I want to be able to deposit it in a bank.

As a bank customer,

As a bank customer,
So that i can keep track of what i have saved,
On request I want to be provvided a bank statement (with date of deposit, amount of deposit and current balance on it).

## Tech / framework used

An apple macbook was used to write code using VSCode as an editor and;

* Ruby was used as the main language.
* RSpec used for testing.
* Capybara used for testing.
* Simplecov used for checking test coverage.

### Code style

Rubocop 0.65.0 was used for linting and stylying the Ruby code.

### Tests

A TDD process was used in the development of this project, please see the
attached spec files for details of the testing that was carried out.
